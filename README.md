Crystal Collector: https://riggs041.github.io/unit-4-game/

Object of the game:
A random number will generate at the start of the game. 

Using the four gems pictured below, click on the images to increase your score until it matches the random number.

Each crystal may add a different amount to your total score. The value of each crystal is hidden so choose wisely.

Once your score matches the random number, you win! But be careful, if your total score exceeds the random number, you lose!

Each time the game starts, a new set of values will be assigned to each crystal.
